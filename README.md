# Image Classification using CNN üñºÔ∏èü§ñ

This project uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and normalization
- CNN architecture with multiple layers
- Model training and evaluation
- Accuracy and loss visualization

## Technologies
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Matplotlib

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install requirements: `pip install tensorflow matplotlib`
3. Run: `python image_classification.py`

## Outcome
- Learned CNNs for image classification
- Achieved ~70% accuracy on CIFAR-10 dataset
